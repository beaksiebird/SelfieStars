# SelfieStars
Camera Work 

This was a more complex app that,when finished, is supposed to allow you to take a selfie, look at other peoples selfies and rate them with stars. 
Selfie Stars contained many concepts such as importing Parse and Bolts frameworks and using IB Designable for shape drawing. 
The complexity of Selfie Stars branches from the fact that it is partially in Objective C and partially in Swift, thus requiring a bridging header and a headache.
